This tutorial has been realized by IBOIS by the collaboration with the laboratory EESD (PI: [savvas.saloustros@epfl.ch](savvas.saloustros@epfl.ch)) in a joint effort of digitzing a masonry wall. The goal of this tutorial series is to help users to reconstruct step by step the process of post-processing cleaning, segmentation, and reconstruction of scanned point cloud data to reconstruct a twin digital wall of a physical masonry artifact.

The tutorial is divided in 3 parts **(a,b,c)**. The first part **(a)** illustrates how to digitize and build a stone data set, the second **(b)** shows how to reallign multiple scans into the same coordinate system and finally **(c)** we relocate the stone model into the wall landscape.
